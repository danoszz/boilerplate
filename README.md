# Boilerplate

[![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/danoszz/boilerplate/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/danoszz/boilerplate#info=devDependencies)

Boilerplate is based on the awesome [Fastshell](https://hosseinkarami.com/fastshell/) but adjusted to the way I like to develop for the web.

The opinionated FastShell framework. Built for the modern developer. For teams and the individual, encouraging a better workflow. JavaScript task running, build processes, autominification and file concatenation, wrapped with an enhanced HTML5 boilerplated framework.

## Including

- All the OG metatags needed for your sharable website
- Nearly all the favicons that ever existed thanks to [Faviconmatic](http://www.favicomatic.com/)
- Minification to the max
